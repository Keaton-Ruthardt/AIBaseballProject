# Diego's Deliverables - Member 1

## Deliverable 1: Initial Setup & Research
**Task**: Explore computer vision tools and test these tools on given baseball footage

### Detailed Explanation
Conduct hands-on research into computer vision tools such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and other detection frameworks by testing them on actual baseball footage. Determine which approaches work best for tracking players, balls, and field positions in complex game scenarios with fast motion, varying camera angles, and challenging lighting conditions.

## Deliverable 2: Core System Development
**Task**: Provide documentation for each feature that we will use

### Detailed Explanation
Produce clear, technical documentation for each of the features we plan to extract from video (such as player positions, velocities, ball trajectory, defensive formations). Explain how they're calculated, what they represent, their measurement units, and how they relate to our prediction model's input requirements. This documentation will be essential for implementation and debugging.

## Deliverable 3: Feature Extraction & Validation
**Task**: Complete video annotations and build our validation dataset

### Detailed Explanation
Collaborate on the time-intensive task of manually annotating videos with ground truth data (player positions, ball locations, advancement outcomes). Create a validation dataset of at least 100-200 plays to benchmark our automated system's performance against human observation. Ensure annotations are accurate, consistent, and well-documented.

## Deliverable 4: Pipeline Integration & Optimization
**Task**: Build visualization system for bounding boxes in the videos and create a probability display

### Detailed Explanation
Develop an intuitive visualization system that overlays bounding boxes around detected players and balls on video footage, displays real-time probability estimates for runner advancement (e.g., "72% chance runner advances"), and creates debug views for system validation. Make the visualizations clear, informative, and useful for both development and demonstration purposes.

## Deliverable 5: Final Documentation & Demo
**Task**: Enhance all visualizations and create final demo graphics

### Detailed Explanation
Enhance all system visualizations to presentation quality, creating final demo graphics showing system architecture diagrams, feature importance visualizations, prediction accuracy charts, example outputs with bounding boxes and probabilities, and compelling visuals for the presentation. Ensure graphics are professional, clear, and effectively communicate the system's capabilities.
