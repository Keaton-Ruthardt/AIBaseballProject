# Joshua's Deliverables - Group Leader

## Deliverable 1: Initial Setup & Research
**Task**: Set up development environment for the team (dependencies, and Titan). Also explore video processing libraries.

### Detailed Explanation
Ensure all team members can develop effectively by configuring the development environment, installing necessary dependencies (Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch), setting up access to the Titan computing cluster for model training, and evaluating video processing libraries like FFmpeg, OpenCV, and MoviePy for our specific needs. Document the setup process to enable smooth onboarding.

## Deliverable 2: Core System Development
**Task**: Build our video processing pipeline for frame extraction. Decide on 30fps or 60fps

### Detailed Explanation
Create a robust video processing pipeline that efficiently extracts frames from game footage. Make the critical decision between 30fps (better performance, lower computational cost) or 60fps (higher temporal resolution, more accurate motion tracking) based on detection accuracy requirements, computational constraints, and the trade-offs between speed and precision.

## Deliverable 3: Feature Extraction & Validation
**Task**: Complete feature extraction pipeline. Measure how many features are being extracted per video

### Detailed Explanation
Finalize and optimize the feature extraction pipeline, running comprehensive tests to measure extraction success rates per video (targeting >90% feature completeness). Identify failure cases, implement error handling for missing or uncertain detections, and create metrics to monitor the pipeline's reliability and performance across different video conditions.

## Deliverable 4: Pipeline Integration & Optimization
**Task**: Optimize pipeline performance and processing speed. Repeated test runs.

### Detailed Explanation
Focus on performance optimization through code profiling, GPU acceleration, batch processing, and parallel frame analysis. Conduct repeated test runs to achieve target processing speeds (ideally near real-time or 2-5x video length for offline analysis). Identify bottlenecks and implement solutions to make the system practical for actual use.

## Deliverable 5: Final Documentation & Demo
**Task**: Write documentation (README, setup guides, code comments)

### Detailed Explanation
Write comprehensive documentation including a main README with project overview and architecture, detailed setup guides for environment configuration and dependencies, installation instructions, usage examples, and thorough code comments throughout the codebase for maintainability. Ensure future developers can understand and extend the system.
