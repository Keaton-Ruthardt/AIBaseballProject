# DuoDuo's Deliverables - Member 2

## Deliverable 1: Initial Setup & Research
**Task**: Research and document different video sources for our training and testing data.

### Detailed Explanation
Create a comprehensive document cataloging potential video sources for our training and testing datasets, including considerations for video quality, frame rates, camera angles, and licensing/access rights. Evaluate sources like MLB.tv, ESPN archives, YouTube channels, and college baseball footage to ensure we have sufficient and appropriate data across different game situations and conditions.

## Deliverable 2: Core System Development
**Task**: Develop coordinate transformation prototype that will make pixels on screen to field position

### Detailed Explanation
Build a coordinate transformation system that converts 2D pixel coordinates from video into real-world field positions (measured in feet from home plate). Account for camera perspective, lens distortion, and different stadium configurations. This is essential for accurate positional analysis and ensures our features represent actual distances and positions on the baseball field.

## Deliverable 3: Feature Extraction & Validation
**Task**: Complete video annotations and build our validation dataset

### Detailed Explanation
Collaborate on the time-intensive task of manually annotating videos with ground truth data (player positions, ball locations, advancement outcomes). Create a validation dataset of at least 100-200 plays to benchmark our automated system's performance against human observation. Document annotation guidelines to ensure consistency across all labeled data.

## Deliverable 4: Pipeline Integration & Optimization
**Task**: Run system validation on test dataset & calculate accuracy metrics

### Detailed Explanation
Conduct rigorous system validation by running the complete pipeline on the test dataset. Calculate accuracy metrics including precision, recall, log loss compared to our baseline (~0.37), and F1 scores. Generate comprehensive error analysis reports identifying where and why the system fails, which features are most problematic, and what conditions lead to prediction errors.

## Deliverable 5: Final Documentation & Demo
**Task**: Finalize presentation slides and prepare our final project

### Detailed Explanation
Design and finalize presentation slides covering project motivation, technical approach, system architecture, results and metrics, challenges overcome, and future work. Prepare all final project deliverables for submission according to course or client requirements. Ensure the presentation tells a compelling story and effectively communicates the project's technical achievements and practical value.
