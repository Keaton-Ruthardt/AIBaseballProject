title: "Week 1 – Environment & OpenCV Setup"
---

# Goals

- Set up Python/virtualenv and dependencies
- Test OpenCV on a sample video
- Start exploring video processing for baseball plays

# Environment Setup

- Created a virtual environment (`cv-env` / `venv`)
- Installed:
  - `opencv-python-headless`
  - `numpy`
  - other core libraries from `requirements.txt`

# OpenCV Test Script

We wrote a small script (`opencv_test.py`) that:

1. Opens a video file (e.g., `sac_fly_001.mp4`)
2. Prints resolution, FPS, and frame count
3. Saves the first frame as an image (`first_frame.jpg`)

```python
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("sac_fly_001.mp4")
if not cap.isOpened():
    raise RuntimeError("Could not open video")

width  = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
fps    = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
frames = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))

print("Resolution:", width, "x", height)
print("FPS:", fps)
print("Total frames:", frames)

ret, frame = cap.read()
if ret:
    cv2.imwrite("first_frame.jpg", frame)

cap.release()
```

This confirmed that the environment and OpenCV were correctly installed and able to read our baseball clips.
