# Project Overview

This book documents a 4-week computer vision + machine learning project that predicts
whether a baserunner will advance on a sacrifice fly.

**End-to-end pipeline:**

> Video → Player tracking (YOLOv8) → Feature extraction → Ensemble model → SAFE/OUT prediction

**Team:**

- Keaton – Pipeline architect (run_complete_pipeline, deployment package)
- Joshua – Validation scripts, performance timing, final documentation
- Duoduo – System evaluation and metrics on real videos
- Samuel – Model improvements and pipeline integration
- Diego – Overlay design and visual demo

Each chapter summarizes what was built in that week and how it connects to the final system.
